HamLibs
=======

A miscellaneous library being created for use with the Harbinger Game Engine, using the Allegro 5 API.
Hamlibs was originally created as a means of creating libraries which could be used across several game projects.
It includes support for configuration files, CSV-style databases, cross-platform filesystem access, character string encryption, and numerous mathematical classes optimized for game engines.

It's still a huge work in progress, so bear with me as I get this and the Harbinger Engine up and running.

Cheers!

NOTES:
=======
*	The actual library files for Windows and Linux are located in the "dist" folder.
*	All source files for the library are located in the "include" and "source" folders.
*	In order to actually build the library from source, the Allegro5 API is needed (http://alleg.sourceforge.net).

TODO:
=======
*	Documentation still needs to be added. For the time being, the only documentation is in the code itself. Hopefully, I made everything self-documenting enough.
