HamLibs
=======

A miscellaneous library being created for use with the Harbinger Game Engine, using the Allegro 5 API.
Hamlibs was originally created in order to have cross-platform libraries which could be used across several game projects.
It includes support for configuration files, CSV-style databases, cross-platform filesystem access, character string encryption, and numerous mathematical classes optimized for game engines.

It's still a huge work in progress, so bear with me as I get this and the Harbinger Engine up and running.

Cheers!
